\section{Conclusion}

\SSc is a complex disease with a little-understood etiology. The pathogenic
interrelationships between manifestations make classifying events as primary
or secondary extremely difficult. Therapies are currently being developed to
treat complications of SSc, primarily external scleroderma. Hopefully, more
research will continue to solve the puzzle of \ssc.
