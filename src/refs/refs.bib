	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) is used as a primary outcome measure in most therapeutic trials in systemic sclerosis (SSc) in adults. Before we can apply this outcome measure in trials in juvenile patients with SSc, we need to evaluate this assessment method in children without sclerodermatous skin changes, to establish values for the normal paediatric population. METHODS: To determine the MRSS in healthy paediatric population, patients of the paediatric rheumatology out-patient clinic with mechanical pain or with juvenile idiopathic arthritis at the age of 16 yr or under were assessed between 1 January and 31 March 2004. Patients with any sign of connective tissue disease or skin disorders, such as psoriasis or ectopic dermatitis, were excluded. The MRSS was determined at a standardized location and with a standardized pinching method. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen patients, including 100 females, were assessed. The mean age of the patients was 10.5 yr (2.9-16), the mean body mass index (BMI) was 18.3 (9.3-35.7), and the mean MRSS was 13.92 (range 4-25). The MRSS score showed a difference between males and females at every Tanner stage. There was a linear correlation between MRSS and body mass index independently of age and Tanner stage. CONCLUSION: The mean MRSS in healthy children is 13.92 units and this range would be expected in a patient with a diffuse form of SSc. The MRSS score in children correlates with the body mass index and the Tanner stage, so it should be corrected to these parameters, according to this pilot study.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: .To examine whether myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA) mRNA expression, commonly considered a reliable marker of Type I interferon (IFN) bioactivity, is modified in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc); if it is associated to specific clinical features; and if its modulation is accompanied by modulation of mRNA for the Type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). METHODS: Quantification of mRNA for MxA and the subunit IFNAR1 and isoforms of IFNAR2 was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 50 patients with SSc. Results were compared with those obtained from healthy controls and patients with another autoimmune disease such as multiple sclerosis. RESULTS:. Levels of MxA mRNA above the 99th percentile of values found in healthy controls were observed in 9 out of 50 patients with SSc (p < 0.001). Induced MxA expression was significantly associated with some features of more severe disease, such as lower forced vital capacity and the presence of ischemic digital ulcers. No differences in the levels of IFNAR were found within MxA-induced and MxA-non-induced patients, but there was a direct correlation between levels of MxA and the soluble isoform of IFNAR2. CONCLUSION:. Our results show induction of MxA expression in some patients with SSc, which correlates with the presence of ischemic ulcers and other signs of worse disease, suggesting a potential role of Type I IFN in the pathogenesis of this disease and/or its complications.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is now growing evidence that connective tissue diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), share a common genetic background. Microarray studies support a pivotal role of type I interferon (IFN) in the pathophysiology of connective tissue diseases. Interferon regulatory factors coordinate the expression of type I IFNs, and the IRF5 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene of systemic lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine whether the IRF5 rs2004640 single-nucleotide polymorphism is associated with SSc. METHODS: The IRF5 rs2004640 (GT) functional polymorphism was genotyped in 1,641 subjects of French European Caucasian origin: a discovery set comprising 427 patients with SSc and 380 control subjects and a replication set comprising 454 patients with SSc and 380 control subjects. RESULTS: In both the discovery set and the replication set, the TT genotype was significantly more common in patients with SSc than in control subjects, with an odds ratio (OR) for the combined populations of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-2.11 [P for trend 0.002]). Analyses of the whole SSc population showed a significant association between homozygosity for the T allele and the presence of antinuclear antibodies (corrected P [Pcorr]=0.04, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.17) and fibrosing alveolitis (Pcorr=0.001, OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.38-3.11). In a multivariate analysis model including the diffuse cutaneous subtype of SSc and positivity for anti-topoisomerase I antibodies, the IRF5 rs2004640 TT genotype remained associated with fibrosing alveolitis (P=0.029, OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.07-3.44). CONCLUSION: The IRF5 rs2004640 GT substitution is associated with susceptibility to SSc. These data provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SSc, including clues to the mechanisms leading to fibrosing alveolitis.},

	Abstract = {Scleroderma renal crisis is irreversible in some patients despite aggressive treatment. This study was designed to identify pathologic prognostic features in scleroderma renal crisis. We retrospectively reviewed the pathology and the clinical records of 17 patients who underwent kidney biopsies during scleroderma renal crisis (group A, recovered renal function [n = 7]; group B, remained in renal failure or died [n = 10]). Multiple histologic features were assessed semiquantitatively (0-3) or as percentages. C4d staining of peritubular capillaries and small vessels was assessed semiquantitatively (0-3) in patients with scleroderma (n = 11), normotensive (n = 10), and hypertensive (n = 12) nonscleroderma native kidney controls. The percentage of thrombosed vessels (25.1 +/- 21.0 versus 5.6 +/- 12.3, P = .045) and the severity of glomerular ischemic collapse (2.9 +/- 0.3 versus 1.4 +/- 0.8, P = .001) were significantly higher in group B than in group A. Also, group B patients tended to have more severe acute tubular injury and vascular fibrinoid changes. The peritubular capillary C4d score in patients with scleroderma, normotensive controls, and hypertensive controls were 1.1 +/- 0.9, 0.3 +/- 0.7, and 0.3 +/- 0.5, respectively (P = .018, scleroderma versus other controls). Small vessel C4d score was higher in scleroderma compared to normotensive but not hypertensive controls. Within scleroderma samples, a significantly higher peritubular capillary C4d score (1.6 +/- 0.7 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5, P = .024) but not small vessel score was found in group B compared to group A. This tended to be associated with peritubular capillary leukocyte margination. Vascular thrombosis, severe glomerular ischemic collapse, and peritubular capillary C4d deposits in scleroderma renal crisis kidney biopsies correlated with increased risk of failure to recover renal function.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, a sensitive biomarker for monitoring cellular stress, in systemic sclerosis (SSc), we investigated the prevalence and clinical correlation of serum Hsp70 levels in SSc patients. METHODS: Serum Hsp70 levels were examined in 48 patients with SSc by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULT: Serum Hsp70 levels were significantly elevated in SSc patients compared to normal controls (n=30), and were similar between patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (n=26) and those with limited cutaneous SSc (n=22). Serum Hsp70 levels were elevated in 27% of total SSc patients with 30% of diffuse cutaneous SSc patients and 23% of limited cutaneous SSc patients. Hsp70 levels were significantly increased in SSc patients with pulmonary fibrosis or contracture of phalanges compared with those without pulmonary fibrosis or contracture of phalanges. Serum Hsp70 levels correlated positively with modified Rodnan total skin thickness score, renal vascular resistance, serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, C-reacting protein, and serum levels of 8-isoprostane. CONCLUSION: Serum Hsp70 levels were increased in SSc patients and were associated with pulmonary fibrosis, skin sclerosis, renal vascular damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These results suggest that Hsp70 is a useful serological marker for evaluating cellular stresses and the disease severity in SSc.},

@article{chizzolini,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A better comprehension of the interactions between cells of the adaptive immune system with fibroblasts and endothelial cells is required to understand abnormal extracellular matrix deposition, development of pathologic fibrosis, and vasculopathy. RECENT FINDINGS: Skin T cells with high IL-4 production potential and peripheral blood T cells preferentially expressing chemokine receptors associated with Th2 functions are found in individuals with active systemic sclerosis. Animal models indicate that Th2 cells and IL-13 can induce muscular hypertrophy in pulmonary arterial vasculature. In bleomycin-induced fibrosis, B cells produce fibrogenic cytokines upon interaction of an endogenous ligand (hyaluronan) with toll-like receptor-4. In the sclerodermatous graft versus host model, the lack of tumor necrosis factor-production by CD4+ T cells is permissive for fibrosis development. Dermal fibrosis and capillary loss typical of systemic sclerosis can be reversible after high-dose immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. SUMMARY: Although immunosuppressive strategies to treat patients with systemic sclerosis and allied conditions are largely disappointing, thus indicating a permissive rather than causative role of immunoinflammatory events characteristic of the disease, new findings stress that cells of the adaptive immune system play important roles in assisting fibrogenesis and vascular abnormalities. This may help in identifying efficacious strategies aimed at their control.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human parvovirus B19 is a small, single-stranded DNA virus encoding two structural capsid proteins and a nonstructural protein. It is the aetiological agent of erythema infectiosum and transient aplastic crisis in patients with haemolytic anaemia, and has been associated with fetal death, arthritis and chronic anaemia. In recent years, the possible involvement of parvovirus B19 in systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been reported. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether human parvovirus B19 DNA can be detected in SSc skin tissue specimens. METHODS: Normal subjects (n = 97) and patients with SSc (n = 48), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 16), dermatomyositis (n = 8), morphoea (n = 6) and graft-versus-host disease (n = 8) were studied. Crude DNA was extracted from skin tissue specimens. We attempted to determine whether human parvovirus B19 could be detected in the skin of SSc using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR amplification was performed with specifically designed first and second primer pairs for parvovirus B19 DNA. RESULTS: After the first PCR, the occurrence rate of parvovirus B19 DNA in SSc skin tissues (36 of 48, 75%) was significantly elevated in comparison with that in normal controls (50 of 97, 52%) (P < 0.01). After the second PCR, the occurrence rate of parvovirus B19 DNA in SSc skin tissues (36 of 48, 75%) was significantly elevated compared with that in normal controls (53 of 97, 55%) (P < 0.02). The occurrence rates in the other diseases showed no significant difference from that in normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of human parvovirus B19 DNA in SSc skin showed the possibility that the virus may be involved in the formation of skin tissue abnormalities in the disease.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morphea is an inflammatory autoimmune skin sclerosis of unknown etiology. A causative role of Borrelia burgdorferi infection has been controversially discussed, but no conclusive solution has yet been achieved. OBJECTIVE: Intrigued by 3 young patients with severe Borrelia-associated morphea and high-titer antinuclear antibodies, we retrospectively examined the relationship between Borrelia exposure, serologic autoimmune phenomena and age at disease onset in morphea patients. METHODS: In 90 morphea patients the presence of Borrelia-specific serum antibodies was correlated to the age at disease onset and the presence and titers of antinuclear antibodies. Patients with active Borrelia infection or high-titer antinuclear antibodies due to systemic sclerosis or lupus erythematosus served as controls. RESULTS: We observed a statistically highly significant association between morphea, serologic evidence of Borrelia infection, and high-titer antinuclear antibodies when disease onset was in childhood or adolescence. LIMITATIONS: Because pathogenic Borrelia species may vary in different geographic regions the relevance of Borrelia infection in morphea induction may show regional variations. CONCLUSION: B burgdorferi infection may be relevant for the induction of a distinct autoimmune type of scleroderma; it may be called "Borrelia-associated early onset morphea" and is characterized by the combination of disease onset at younger age, infection with B burgdorferi, and evident autoimmune phenomena as reflected by high-titer antinuclear antibodies. As exemplified by the case reports, it may take a particularly severe course and require treatment of both infection and skin inflammation.},

@article{szekanecz,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are expressed on inflammatory cells. We previously detected increased production of CA15-3, CA19-9 and CA125 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The production of some TAAs may also be increased in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other connective tissue diseases. Some of these TAAs contain sialylated carbohydrate motifs and they are involved in tumor-associated cell adhesion and metastasis. OBJECTIVES: We assessed levels of TAAs in the sera of SSc, SLE patients, patients with infectious diseases and healthy subjects. Serum TAA levels were correlated with each other, as well as with disease activity markers and organ involvement. METHODS: TAAs including CEA, CA15-3, CA72-4, CA125 and CA19-9 were assessed by immunoassay in the sera of 92 patients with SSc, 40 patients with SLE, 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, as well as with 40 patients with current bacterial or viral infections. Normal upper limits for these TAAs were 3.4 mg/l, 25 kU/l, 6.9 kU/l, 35 kU/l and 34 kU/l, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more SSc patients showing abnormally high levels of CA19-9 (8.8% vs 2.0%), CA125 (11.0% vs 6.0%) and CA15-3 (28.4% vs 14.0%) in comparison to controls (p < 0.05). In SLE, significantly more patients had elevated levels of CEA (32.5% vs 20.0%), CA19-9 (7.5% vs 2.0%), CA125 (15.0% vs 6.0%) and CA72-4 (15.0% vs 8.0%) than did controls (p < 0.05). The mean absolute serum levels of CEA (6.6+/-1.7 vs 1.8+/-1.4 mg/l) and CA15-3 (22.9 +/- 1.8 vs 18.6 +/- 2.2 kU/l) were also significantly higher in SSc compared to controls (p < 0.05). We found numerous correlations between the serum levels of different TAAs within the SSc and SLE population. Among SSc patients, serum CEA (R = 0.290; p = 0.005), CA15-3 (R = 0.260; p = 0.020) and CA19-9 (R = 0.257; p = 0.013) correlated with renal involvement. Serum CA15-3 also correlated with joint involvement (R = 0.329; p = 0.003), ANA positivity (R = 0.288; p = 0.010) and CRP levels (R = 0.407; p < 0.001). Within the SLE population, serum CA72-4 correlated with central nervous involvement (R = 0.624; p = 0.004) and CA125 correlated with the SLEDAI composite activity index (R = 0.666; p = 0.002). Patients with infections exerted serum TAA patterns similar to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The concentration of some TAAs may be elevated in the sera of patients with SSc or SLE in comparison to healthy subjects. Pathogenically, most of these TAAs contain carbohydrate motifs and thus they may be involved in inflammation-associated adhesive events. Furthermore, the production of some TAAs may correlate with organ involvement or disease activity in scleroderma or lupus.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of stressful life events in the year before the initiation of systemic sclerosis. METHODS: A consecutive series of 40 patients with systemic sclerosis (mean age (56.3+/-11.9) years, mean disease duration (4.3+/-3.1) years; 32 females and 8 males), including 28 with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and 12 with limited cutaneous scleroderma, were evaluated. A control group of 40 healthy subjects free of systemic sclerosis also was included. Socioeconomic status was investigated and Paykel's interview for recent life events (a semi-structured research interview covering 64 life events) was conducted. RESULTS: Patients with systemic sclerosis showed higher percentages of lower education (72.5%) and working class (82.5%), and reported more stressful life events (P<0.05), such as exits (P<0.05), undesirable events (P<0.01), and uncontrolled events (P<0.001), when compared with the control. More events that had an objective negative impact (P<0.001) were also reported in systemic sclerosis patients than in the control. These results are in accordance with a multifactorial model of pathogenesis in systemic sclerosis. CONCLUSION: We reported a strong relationship between stressful life events and the initiation of systemic sclerosis. Our findings are consistent with current understanding of the extensive links of behavioral responses to stress with neurophysiological and biochemical processes.},

	Abstract = {Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) results from an exaggerated cutaneous vasospastic response to cold or emotional stress. The mechanisms that lead to impaired cutaneous vascular tone are complex. The regulation of cutaneous vasoconstriction and vasodilation, involves altered sympathetic nerve activity and a host of neuronal regulators, including adrenergic and non-adrenergic, as well as REDOX signalling and other signalling such as the RhoA/ROCK pathway. This review summarises the literature concerning the regulation of vascular tone by neurohumoral factors that may be involved in RP and systemic sclerosis (SSc).},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In SSc, diagnosis and classification is based mainly on skin sclerosis. Herein, we investigated in a large multicentre cohort, to what extent skin sclerosis reflects organ involvement and additional clinical symptoms. METHODS: A total of 1200 SSc patients from the register of the German Systemic Sclerosis Network (DNSS), classified as either lcSSc or dcSSc, were analysed for their serological characteristics, clinical symptoms and organ manifestations in relation to skin involvement measured by the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS). RESULTS: SSc patients with different mRSS did not differ significantly in their disease duration and in most of the clinical symptoms. They showed a similar distribution of most organ manifestations such as pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as cardiac, renal and nervous system involvement. More severe skin thickening was found to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as with digital ulcers and musculoskeletal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SSc, potentially life-threatening complications and clinical symptoms with high impact on the quality of life occur independently from the extent of skin sclerosis. The diagnosis in SSc patients with a low mRSS could be missed or they could be insufficiently treated.},

The presence of giant capillaries and microhaemorrhages on nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) is sufficient to identify the scleroderma pattern (early), and an increase in these features and the addition of loss of capillaries (active pattern) is followed by neo-angiogenesis, fibrosis and 'desertification' (late pattern). The sensitivity of the American College of Rheumatology's classification criteria for SSc increases from 67% to 99% with the addition of these specific NVC abnormalities. Based on the appearance of the scleroderma pattern on NVC, almost 15% of patients shift from primary to secondary RP over a mean follow-up period of 29.4+/-10 months. Follow-up by NVC (every 6 months) is suggested for RP patients. A scoring system for NVC changes is available, and scores change significantly during follow-up of SSc patients. Several other NVC patterns have also been identified, such as in dermatomyosistis, systemic lupus eythaematosus, mixed connective tissue disease and antiphospholipid syndrome.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To verify whether myocardial impairment can be detected by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in patients with asymptomatic systemic sclerosis (SSc), 35 patients with SSc with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and 35 control subjects were studied. METHODS: Myocardial longitudinal peak systolic velocity, strain, and strain rate (SR) were measured by TDI at a regional level, and for each parameter the average value was calculated using an LV 12-segment model. In addition, the mitral annulus diastolic velocities and the E/Ea ratio were obtained. Myocardial calibrated integrated backscatter (cIB) was used as an index of fibrosis. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with SSc showed lower peak strain (-19.5% +/- 2.3% vs -26.1% +/- 2.4%, P < .001), peak SR (-1.34 +/- 0.14 s(-1) vs -1.59 +/- 0.14 s(-1), P < .001), septal cIB (-19.5 +/- 3.1 dB vs -23.8 +/- 1.6 dB, P < .001), and posterior wall cIB (-23.4 +/- 2.9 dB vs -28.6 +/- 2.5 dB, P = .001), and higher E/Ea (11.7 +/- 2.5 vs 9.8 +/- 1.1, P < .001), whereas peak systolic velocities did not differ. Strain, SR, and E/Ea correlated better with cIB than systolic velocities. CONCLUSION: TDI-derived strain, SR, and E/Ea can detect impairment of LV myocardial function in asymptomatic patients with SSc with normal LV ejection fraction better than TDI systolic velocities.},

@article{allanore,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary myocardial involvement is common in systemic sclerosis. There is strong evidence that this involvement is related to repeat focal ischemic injury causing irreversible myocardial fibrosis. Clinically evident cardiac involvement is recognized to be a poor prognostic factor; thus preclinical identification is highly encouraged. RECENT FINDINGS: The severity of heart involvement has been confirmed and patients having systemic sclerosis with antitopoisomerase I antibodies seem to be at higher risk. Echocardiography, coupled, if possible, to pulsed tissue Doppler, is the cornerstone of heart assessment. Myocardial perfusion may be assessed by single photon emission computed tomography. When available, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging should be considered as it allows simultaneous measurement of volumes and ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, and assessment of possible inflammation and/or fibrosis. SUMMARY: As a result of recent innovations, clinicians have a large panel of methods - some of these possibly reserved for research--whereas the others seem to be widely available and suitable for routine clinical practice. Indeed, conventional echocardiography, pulsed tissue Doppler, and natriuretic peptides may be used for routine assessment.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is an uncommon connective tissue disease characterised by vascular, inflammatory and fibrotic dysfunction of multiple organ systems. Systemic sclerosis is often recognised late in the course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the clinical features of systemic sclerosis, in particular 'red flags' that indicate the presence of significant organ disease. DISCUSSION: Common clinical features include Raynaud phenomenon and skin thickening, often with calcinosis and telangiectasia. These features should alert the physician to look for red flag features. In the general practice setting, early recognition of scleroderma will enable timely referral to specialist centres for regular screening and effective management of its many serious visceral complications.},
