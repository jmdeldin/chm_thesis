	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is an uncommon connective tissue disease characterised by vascular, inflammatory and fibrotic dysfunction of multiple organ systems. Systemic sclerosis is often recognised late in the course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the clinical features of systemic sclerosis, in particular 'red flags' that indicate the presence of significant organ disease. DISCUSSION: Common clinical features include Raynaud phenomenon and skin thickening, often with calcinosis and telangiectasia. These features should alert the physician to look for red flag features. In the general practice setting, early recognition of scleroderma will enable timely referral to specialist centres for regular screening and effective management of its many serious visceral complications.},
